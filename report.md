# üöó Car Price and Feature Analysis

## üìä Project Overview

This analysis provides a comprehensive look into how different attributes of cars such as make, model, mileage, transmission, condition, accident history, color, and features impact their prices and popularity. The dataset is structured across multiple normalized tables, and insights were extracted using **SQL** for deeper understanding.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

**Data Source**: The data was collected and normalised into a database with the following key tables:
```
select * from fact a
inner join accident b on a.AccidentID = b.AccidentID
inner join color c on a.ColorID = c.ColorID
inner join condition d on a.ConditionID = d.ConditionID
inner join fuel_type e on a.Fuel_TypeID = e.Fuel_TypeID
inner join make f on a.Car_MakeID = f.Car_MakeID
inner join model g on a.Car_ModelID = g.Car_ModelID
inner join options h on a.Options_FeaturesID = h.Options_FeaturesID
inner join transmission i on a.TransmissionID = i.TransmissionID
inner join [year] j on a.YearID = j.YearID 
```

* `fact` ‚Äì Core dataset with car listings
* `make`, `model`, `year`, `color`, `condition`, `fuel_type`, `transmission`, `accident`, `options` ‚Äì Dimensional tables providing attribute information

**Joins**: SQL `INNER JOIN`s were used to merge these tables with `fact`, enabling feature-rich queries.

**Statistical Techniques Used**:

* `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()` for aggregations
* `PERCENTILE_CONT()` for calculating medians
* Grouping and filtering to explore feature correlations and trends

## üîç Key Insights

### 1. üí∞ Price & Value Analytics

#### A. Average, Median, and Maximum Price by Make and Model

* Each car make and model was analyzed to determine **average**, **maximum**, and **median** prices.
```
with stats as ( 
				select b.Car_Make, c.Car_Model, price, percentile_cont(0.5) within group (order by a.price) over (partition by b.car_make, c.car_model) as median
				from fact a
						inner join make b on a.Car_MakeID = b.Car_MakeID
						inner join model c on a.Car_ModelID = c.Car_ModelID
)
select car_make,
		car_model,
		avg(price) as average_price,
		max(price) as maximum_price,
		max(median) as median
from stats
group by car_make, car_model
order by average_price desc
```

* Average Price
‚Ä¢	General Range:
o	Most mainstream vehicles: $21,000 ‚Äì $25,000
o	Luxury brands (Porsche, Tesla, Mercedes-Benz): $80,000 ‚Äì $100,000
o	Ultra-luxury brands (Bugatti, Bentley, McLaren): $190,000 ‚Äì $210,000+
* Maximum Price
‚Ä¢	Peak Values:
o	Many luxury and exotic models top out near $299,000
o	Most mainstream brands max around $49,000 ‚Äì $50,000
* Median Price
‚Ä¢	Typical Midpoints:
o	Mainstream cars: $21,000 ‚Äì $24,000
o	Mid-luxury cars: $24,000 ‚Äì $26,000
o	Exotic/luxury brands maintain high medians around $190,000 ‚Äì $215,000

* Luxury cars (e.g., Bugatti, Aston Martin) dominate the top of all price metrics, Porsche and Tesla show large gaps between average and median, indicating multiple trims from entry-level to premium, Mainstream brands (Toyota, Honda, Hyundai) offer stable, consistent pricing across all metrics. Budget cars (Fiat, Nissan) stay within a tight range with low max and median values.



#### B. Impact of Mileage on Price
```
select b.car_make, avg(a.mileage) as mileage, avg(a.price) as price 
from fact a
	inner join make b on a.Car_MakeID = b.Car_MakeID --we will know more using a visualization technique
	group by b.car_make
	order by mileage asc
```

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a91b2ba9-99f2-4676-ac60-0768ccc27b97)

* Generally, **higher mileage** correlated with **lower average prices**, particularly.
* A clear **inverse relationship** was seen‚Äîreinforcing that lower mileage increases resale value.

#### C. Price by Fuel Type
```
select b.fuel_type, round(avg(a.Price),1) as average_price 
from fact a
	inner join fuel_type b on a.Fuel_TypeID = b.Fuel_TypeID
	
	group by b.Fuel_Type
	order by average_price desc
```
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d452567-56de-410f-9d72-5d7bc94a662c)

* **Petrol** was the most common and showed moderate pricing.
* **Petrol** vehicles have the highest average price by far, Likely due to luxury brands (e.g., Ferrari, McLaren, Bugatti) still using petrol engines. **Electric, Diesel, and Hybrid** cars are priced within a similar mid-range ($45k‚Äì$47k). **Gasoline** (likely standard internal combustion) has the lowest average price, around $22,763.

### 2. üîß Condition & Accident Insights

#### A. Price Differences by Condition
```
with comparison as (
					select 
					b.Condition, 
					a.Price,
					percentile_cont(0.5) within group (order by price) over (partition by condition) as median
					from fact a
						inner join condition b on a.ConditionID = b.ConditionID
						
)
select condition,
		avg(price) as average_price,
		min(price) as minimum_price,
		max(price) as maximum_price,
		max(median) as median_price
from comparison
group by condition
order by condition
```
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3f2d17f-1b61-4088-a504-2783855ee325)

* **Like New cars** have the highest average and median prices, slightly more than both **New and Used cars**, This could reflect a concentration of high-end or luxury models in that category.
* **New cars** have the lowest minimum price, likely from entry-level vehicles or promotional offers.
* **Used cars** have the lowest median price, indicating more affordability and possibly a wider range of older, depreciated models.

#### B. Accident History Impact
```
select b.car_make, c.accident, avg(a.Price) as average_price 
from fact a
		inner join make b on a.Car_MakeID = b.Car_MakeID

## üìå Recommendations

1. **Dealers** can price inventory more competitively by understanding make/model and condition price patterns.
2. **Buyers** should consider fuel type, transmission, and accident history for cost-efficient choices.
3. **Marketing teams** can use color and feature trends to inform promotion strategies.
4. **Sellers** can increase listing value with verified condition and feature documentation.
