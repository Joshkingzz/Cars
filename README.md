# 🚗 Car Market & Price Analytics

This project explores an extensive car sales dataset using **SQL** and **Python** to generate insights into pricing, performance, feature influence, and accident impact. The project is structured into three main folders: `data`, `sql`, and `python`, each serving a unique function in the analytical pipeline.

While all data modeling, transformation, and querying were done locally, **final reporting** was hosted on my portfolio website.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project provides a detailed analytical exploration of car-related data to understand:

* Price behavior across makes and models
* Impact of mileage, fuel type, and transmission
* Influence of accident history on price and mileage
* Trends in features, aesthetics, and vehicle condition

The dataset contains over **23,000 car entries** joined across various dimension tables (e.g., make, model, year, fuel type, transmission, features), enabling rich, relational insights.

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered

* What’s the average, max, and median price by make and model?
* How does mileage influence car price?
* Which fuel types are most expensive?
* Are accident-history cars sold for less?
* What transmission types are most common?
* What feature combinations appear most often?
* Do premium features or colors increase value?
